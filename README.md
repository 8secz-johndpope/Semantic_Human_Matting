# Semantic_Human_Matting
The project is my reimplement of paper ([Semantatic Human Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01354)) that proposes a new end-to-end scheme to predict human alpha from image. SHM is the first algorithm that learns to jointly fit both semantic information and high quality details with deep networks. The architecture of my network, which builded with mobilenet and shallow encoder-decoder net, is a light version compaired to original implement.
